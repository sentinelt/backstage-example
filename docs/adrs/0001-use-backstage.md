# ADR 1: Use Backstage to Manage ADRs

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) are essential for documenting the architectural decisions made during the development process. Managing ADRs effectively is crucial to ensure they are easily accessible, well-organized, and integrated into the development workflow.

Backstage is an open-source developer portal that provides a centralized platform for managing documentation, tools, and services. It offers features such as a plugin system, search capabilities, and integration with version control systems, making it a suitable candidate for managing ADRs.

## Decision
We will use Backstage as the tool to manage and maintain ADRs.

## Consequences
### Positive Consequences
- **Centralized Management**: All ADRs will be accessible from a single platform, improving discoverability and organization.
- **Integration with Development Workflow**: Backstage integrates with version control systems like Git, ensuring ADRs are versioned and tracked.
- **Search and Navigation**: Backstage provides robust search and navigation features, making it easier for developers to find relevant ADRs.
- **Extensibility**: Backstage's plugin system allows for customization and integration with other tools in our ecosystem.

### Negative Consequences
- **Initial Setup Effort**: Setting up Backstage and configuring it for ADR management will require time and resources.
- **Learning Curve**: Team members may need to familiarize themselves with Backstage to use it effectively.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Markdown Files in Git Repository**: Storing ADRs as plain Markdown files in a Git repository.
   - Pros: Simple and lightweight.
   - Cons: Lacks advanced search, navigation, and integration features.
2. **Confluence**: Using Confluence as a documentation tool.
   - Pros: Rich editing features and collaboration capabilities.
   - Cons: Requires a license and may not integrate seamlessly with our development workflow.

## Rationale
Backstage provides a balance between simplicity and functionality. Its integration with Git ensures ADRs are version-controlled, while its extensibility and search capabilities make it a powerful tool for managing architectural decisions.
